This is my code for the Build Responsive Real World Websites with HTML5 and CSS3 course.

The objective with this repository is to keep simple examples of how to use CSS3 and HTML tags basics.

## About the website

It has some basic sections about a fictional delivery company. It is only for my self development purpose, not for production website. If anyone wants to point what to improve feel free to comment or open an Issue. The sections are:

* Main
* Presentation
* Image Gallery
* How it works
* Current Cities
* Testimonials
* Pricing plans
* Feedback form
